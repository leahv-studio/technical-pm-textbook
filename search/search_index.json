When an engineer says \"this will take three sprints because we need to refactor the data access layer,\" you should understand what that means and why it matters.</p> <p>Software development is not a single activity but a collection of interconnected disciplines. It encompasses writing code, designing system architecture, testing for correctness, managing dependencies, deploying to production, and monitoring performance. Each of these activities has its own tools, practices, and vocabulary that you'll encounter throughout this course.</p> <p>The development process typically follows a cycle:</p> <ol> <li>Requirements gathering - Translating user needs and business requirements into technical specifications</li> <li>Design - Choosing the architecture, data structures, and patterns that will guide implementation</li> <li>Implementation - Writing the actual source code</li> <li>Testing - Verifying that the code works correctly and handles edge cases</li> <li>Deployment - Releasing the software to users</li> <li>Maintenance - Fixing bugs, improving performance, and adding features over time</li> </ol>"},{"location":"chapters/02-software-development-essentials/#source-code-the-foundation","title":"Source Code: The Foundation","text":"<p>Source code is the human-readable set of instructions written by developers that defines how a software application behaves.

A typical project might have hundreds or thousands of source code files, each responsible for a different aspect of the application. Understanding this structure helps you navigate technical conversations and review engineering proposals.</p> <p>Here's what a simple piece of source code looks like in Python, a language commonly used for data analysis and backend services:</p> <pre><code>def calculate_conversion_rate(conversions, total_visitors):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the conversion rate as a percentage.\"\"\"\n    if total_visitors == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    return (conversions / total_visitors) * 100\n\n# Example usage\nrate = calculate_conversion_rate(150, 2000)\nprint(f\"Conversion rate: {rate}%\")  # Output: Conversion rate: 7.5%\n</code></pre> <p>You don't need to write code like this, but being able to read it and understand its intent is a valuable technical PM skill.

It encompasses everything from high-level architecture overviews to detailed API references, from product requirement documents to runbooks that engineers consult at 2 a.m. during an outage.

The chapter's advantages table for monolithic architecture explicitly lists \"good performance (no network calls between components)\" as a benefit. The other options describe characteristics of microservices, not monoliths. In a monolith, all functionality runs as a single process, which eliminates the network latency overhead that exists when services communicate across a network.

Containerization packages an application together with all its dependencies - code, runtime, libraries, and system tools - into a single, portable unit called a container. This solves the classic \"it works on my machine\" problem by ensuring the application behaves identically regardless of where it is deployed, whether on a developer's laptop, a test server, or production infrastructure.

Vertical scaling (also called \"scaling up\") means increasing the capacity of a single machine by adding more CPU, memory, storage, or network bandwidth. Upgrading from 16 GB to 64 GB of RAM on the same server is the textbook example of vertical scaling. It is the simplest approach since it requires no code changes or distributed system complexity, but it has limitations: a physical hardware ceiling, potential downtime during upgrades, and a single point of failure.</p> <p>Concept Tested: Vertical Scaling</p>"},{"location":"chapters/05-cloud-computing-infrastructure/quiz/#5-your-team-is-evaluating-serverless-computing-for-a-new-feature-that-processes-uploaded-images-which-characteristic-makes-serverless-well-suited-for-this-use-case","title":"5.

Serverless computing is event-driven, meaning functions execute in response to triggers such as file uploads, API calls, or database changes. When an image is uploaded, a serverless function can be triggered to process it, and the platform automatically scales from zero to thousands of concurrent executions based on demand.

Horizontal scaling adds more machines to distribute workload, and its cost curve is linear and predictable - each additional machine costs roughly the same. The chapter specifically notes that vertical scaling has a non-linear cost curve, where a server with twice the CPU often costs more than twice as much.

A cache hit rate represents the percentage of requests served from the fast cache versus the slower backend. At 45%, more than half of all requests are going to the backend database or compute layer instead of being served from the cache, which is dramatically faster.

An API specifies what requests a system accepts, what data it expects, and what responses it returns.

The kitchen (backend system) handles the actual work, but you interact only through the menu.</p> <p>As a technical PM, APIs are arguably the most important technical concept you will encounter. Nearly every modern product either exposes an API for others to use, consumes APIs from third-party services, or both.

You will not need to write tests yourself, but you will need to understand why your engineering team insists on certain quality gates, how testing strategies affect release timelines, and when investing in debt reduction yields better returns than building new features.</p> <p>The PM\\'s Role in Quality</p> <p>You don\\'t need to be the person who writes tests or refactors code. Your job is to understand the business impact of quality decisions, create space in the roadmap for quality investments, and help the team make informed trade-offs between speed and sustainability.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/09-quality-assurance-technical-debt/#understanding-technical-debt","title":"Understanding Technical Debt","text":"<p>Technical debt is the implied cost of future rework caused by choosing an expedient solution today instead of a better approach that would take longer to implement. The metaphor was coined by Ward Cunningham in 1992 and draws a deliberate parallel to financial debt: you borrow against future productivity to deliver something now, and you pay interest on that loan through increased maintenance costs, slower feature development, and higher defect rates until you repay the principal by fixing the underlying problem.</p> <p>Technical debt is not inherently bad. Just as financial debt can be a strategic tool - taking a mortgage to buy a house, or borrowing to fund a business - technical debt can be a rational product decision. Launching a feature with a simpler-but-less-scalable implementation to validate market demand before investing in a robust architecture is a perfectly sound strategy. The problems arise when debt accumulates without tracking, when teams take on debt unintentionally, or when leadership refuses to allocate time for repayment.</p> <p>Technical debt generally falls into four categories:</p> Type Description Example Risk Level Deliberate, Prudent Conscious decision to ship quickly with known trade-offs \"We\\'ll use a flat file instead of a database for the MVP and migrate later\" Low (planned) Deliberate, Reckless Conscious decision to cut corners without a repayment plan \"We don\\'t have time for tests, just ship it\" High Inadvertent, Prudent Learning from experience reveals a better approach \"Now that we understand the domain better, this module should be restructured\" Medium Inadvertent, Reckless Poor practices due to lack of knowledge or discipline Duplicated code, no documentation, hardcoded values everywhere Very High"},{"location":"chapters/09-quality-assurance-technical-debt/#diagram-technical-debt-quadrant","title":"Diagram: Technical Debt Quadrant","text":"Technical Debt Quadrant <p>Type: diagram</p> <p>Bloom Level: Analyze (L4) Bloom Verb: classify, differentiate Learning Objective: Students will be able to classify examples of technical debt into the four quadrants and differentiate between strategic and harmful debt accumulation.</p> <p>Layout: 2x2 matrix with \"Deliberate vs. Inadvertent\" on the horizontal axis and \"Prudent vs. Reckless\" on the vertical axis.

High-quality code is easy for developers to understand, modify, and extend. Low-quality code - often called \"spaghetti code\" - is tangled, poorly documented, and fragile, meaning that changing one part frequently breaks another. As a product manager, you cannot assess code quality by reading the code yourself, but you can recognize the symptoms of poor code quality in your team\\'s velocity and defect rates.</p> <p>Indicators that code quality may be degrading include:</p> <ul> <li>Feature delivery slows down even though team size has not changed</li> <li>Bug rates increase, especially regressions (bugs in previously working features)</li> <li>Engineers estimate simple-sounding features as taking weeks instead of days</li> <li>New team members take months to become productive</li> <li>The same components appear repeatedly in incident reports</li> </ul> <p>Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves the internal structure - making the code cleaner, more modular, and easier to extend - while keeping the product\\'s functionality identical from the user\\'s perspective. Think of it as renovating the plumbing and wiring of a house while the family continues living in it. The house looks the same from the outside, but it works better on the inside.</p> <p>How to Talk About Refactoring with Stakeholders</p> <p>Stakeholders often resist refactoring because it produces no visible features. Frame refactoring in business terms: \"This refactoring will reduce our average bug-fix time from 3 days to 1 day, letting us ship features 20% faster next quarter.\" Always connect engineering investments to business outcomes.</p> <p>Common refactoring triggers that a PM should recognize:</p> <ul> <li>High coupling - Changes to one module require changes to many others</li> <li>Code duplication - The same logic exists in multiple places, creating inconsistency risk</li> <li>Long methods - Functions that do too many things and are difficult to test</li> <li>Outdated patterns - Code using deprecated libraries or obsolete architecture patterns</li> </ul>"},{"location":"chapters/09-quality-assurance-technical-debt/#legacy-systems-and-system-migration","title":"Legacy Systems and System Migration","text":"<p>Legacy systems are older software applications or platforms that remain in active use because they serve critical business functions, even though they may use outdated technology, lack modern features, or be difficult and expensive to maintain. Legacy systems are not necessarily bad systems - many were excellently designed for their era - but they become liabilities when they cannot integrate with modern tools, when the engineers who understand them retire, or when they cannot scale to meet current demands.</p> <p>As a technical PM, you will almost certainly inherit at least one legacy system. The question is never \"should we replace it?\" but rather \"when, how, and at what pace should we modernize it?\" Ripping out a legacy system and replacing it all at once (known as a \"big bang\" migration) is almost always riskier than a phased approach.</p> <p>System migration is the process of moving a product, application, or data from one technology platform or architecture to another. Migrations are among the highest-risk, highest-impact projects a technical PM will manage. They require careful planning, extensive testing, and clear communication because a failed migration can cause data loss, extended downtime, and customer churn.</p> Migration Strategy Approach Risk Timeline Best For Big Bang Replace everything at once on a cutover date Very High Short Small, simple systems with low data volume Strangler Fig Gradually replace legacy components while both systems run Low-Medium Long Large, complex systems with many integrations Parallel Run Run old and new systems simultaneously, comparing outputs Medium Medium Financial or compliance-critical systems Phased Rollout Migrate users or features in stages Medium Medium-Long Systems with distinct user segments or modules <p>The strangler fig pattern - named after the tropical tree that gradually envelops and replaces its host - is particularly popular for large-scale migrations. You route new functionality through the new system while the old system continues to handle existing features. Over time, more and more traffic flows through the new system until the legacy system can be safely decommissioned.</p> <p>Migration Risks PMs Must Watch</p> <p>The three most common causes of migration failure are: (1) incomplete data migration that loses or corrupts records, (2) undocumented integrations with the legacy system that break when it changes, and (3) underestimating user retraining needs.

When a unit test fails, the developer usually knows exactly which function is broken.</p> <p>Consider a simple example. If your product has a pricing engine that calculates discounts, a unit test might verify that \"when a customer has a 20% coupon and their cart total is $100, the function returns $80.\" The test does not launch the full application, does not connect to a database, and does not render a user interface. It tests one function with one set of inputs and checks one expected output.</p> <p>From a PM perspective, unit tests matter because they give the team confidence to make changes quickly.

High coverage does not guarantee high quality - it is entirely possible to have 100% code coverage with tests that check trivial conditions and miss critical edge cases. Conversely, a team with 60% coverage focused on the most important and complex code paths may have a more effective test suite than a team with 90% coverage spread uniformly. Industry benchmarks typically target 70-80% coverage as a healthy goal, with critical paths expected to exceed 90%.</p> <p>The Code Coverage Trap</p> <p>Do not set code coverage as a rigid target that teams must hit.

As a technical PM, understanding the SDLC helps you anticipate what comes next, identify bottlenecks, and communicate realistic timelines to stakeholders.</p> <p>The SDLC typically includes the following phases, though different methodologies organize and sequence them differently:</p> <ol> <li>Requirements gathering - Defining what the software should do and for whom</li> <li>Design - Planning the architecture, data models, and user interfaces</li> <li>Implementation - Writing the actual code</li> <li>Testing - Verifying that the software works correctly (covered in Chapter 9)</li> <li>Deployment - Releasing the software to users</li> <li>Maintenance - Fixing bugs, addressing technical debt, and evolving the product</li> </ol> <p>The critical insight is that these phases are not one-and-done. In modern software development, teams cycle through these phases continuously - sometimes completing the full cycle in a matter of days. The methodology a team uses determines how quickly they complete each cycle, how much they plan upfront versus discover along the way, and how they handle changes to requirements.</p> <p>Why PMs Must Understand the SDLC</p> <p>You cannot effectively plan a roadmap, estimate timelines, or manage stakeholder expectations if you do not understand how software is actually built.

It works well when requirements are well understood and unlikely to change, when regulatory compliance demands extensive upfront documentation, and when the cost of making changes increases dramatically after deployment (embedded systems, hardware-software interfaces, safety-critical applications).</p> <p>However, Waterfall has significant limitations for modern software products:</p> Waterfall Characteristic Impact on Product Development Requirements locked early Cannot incorporate user feedback until after launch Testing at the end Bugs discovered late are expensive to fix Big-bang delivery Users wait months or years for value Change-resistant Scope changes require costly rework of earlier phases Heavy documentation Time spent documenting may exceed time spent building <p>The fundamental problem with Waterfall for most software products is that you cannot fully specify requirements for something users have never seen.

Churn is the inverse of retention - high churn means low retention and vice versa.

You have learned about software development, technical documentation, system architecture, cloud computing, APIs, databases, quality assurance, agile methodologies, analytics, experimentation, and AI tools. More importantly, you have developed frameworks for thinking about these topics - frameworks that will serve you long after specific technologies have evolved.</p> <p>The transition from product manager to technical product manager is not about memorizing technical specifications or learning to write production code. It is about building the technical judgment to make better product decisions - knowing when to push for a platform investment, when to question an engineering estimate, when to simplify a requirement to reduce technical complexity, and when to advocate for technical debt reduction over new features.</p> <p>Your competitive advantage as a transitioning PM is the combination of strong product instincts with growing technical depth. Engineers who become PMs often struggle with the ambiguity of product strategy and user research. Business-trained PMs often struggle with the precision of technical decision-making. You are building both muscles, and that combination is rare and valuable.</p> <p>The tools covered in this course - especially AI-powered tools for code understanding, data analysis, and learning - make this transition more achievable than ever before. Use them daily. Build the habit of curiosity about how things work. Ask engineers not just what they are building, but why they chose that approach and what alternatives they considered. Every conversation is a learning opportunity, and every technical decision you participate in strengthens your judgment.</p> <p>Start your personal learning plan this week. Not next month, not when things calm down - this week. Block the time, choose your first learning goal, and take the first step.

How does the message differ?</li> <li>Your team needs a user authentication system. Walk through a build vs buy analysis, identifying the key factors that would influence your recommendation.</li> <li>Create a one-quarter personal learning plan with specific weekly goals, learning methods, and success criteria.</li> <li>Design a dual-track roadmap for a product that needs both a major new feature and a database migration.
