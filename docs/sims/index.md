# Interactive MicroSims

Interactive simulations to help product managers build technical fluency through hands-on exploration.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **[A/B Test Calculator](./ab-test-calculator/index.md)**

    Simulate a full A/B test experiment to see why sample size matters, how confidence builds over time, and what happens when you stop early.

-   **[API Request Builder](./api-request-builder/index.md)**

    Interactive p5.js simulation demonstrating the REST API request and response cycle. Explore HTTP methods, endpoints, status codes, and request/response bodies.

-   **[SQL Query Builder](./sql-query-builder/index.md)**

    Build SQL queries visually against a sample database with Customers, Orders, and Products tables. Learn SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and JOIN by constructing queries and seeing the results.

-   **[Technical Debt Simulator](./technical-debt-simulator/index.md)**

    Play through 12 sprints choosing to ship fast or refactor. Watch how technical debt compounds into delivery slowdowns and compare your strategy against a balanced team.
