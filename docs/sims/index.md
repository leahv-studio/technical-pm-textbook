# Interactive MicroSims

Interactive simulations to help product managers build technical fluency through hands-on exploration.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **[A/B Test Calculator](./ab-test-calculator/index.md)**

    Simulate a full A/B test experiment to see why sample size matters, how confidence builds over time, and what happens when you stop early.

-   **[Availability & Downtime Calculator](./availability-calculator/index.md)**

    Explore how uptime percentages translate to real downtime and revenue impact. Compare "nines" of availability from 90% to 99.9999% and understand the engineering cost at each tier.

-   **[API Request Builder](./api-request-builder/index.md)**

    Interactive p5.js simulation demonstrating the REST API request and response cycle. Explore HTTP methods, endpoints, status codes, and request/response bodies.

-   **[SQL Query Builder](./sql-query-builder/index.md)**

    Build SQL queries visually against a sample database with Customers, Orders, and Products tables. Learn SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and JOIN by constructing queries and seeing the results.

-   **[Database Normalization Visualizer](./normalization-visualizer/index.md)**

    Watch a denormalized table transform through 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF step by step. See redundant data highlighted and anomalies resolved at each stage.

-   **[Monolith vs. Microservices Explorer](./monolith-vs-microservices/index.md)**

    Adjust team size, system complexity, and expected users to see the architecture visually morph between monolith, modular monolith, and microservices with contextual recommendations.

-   **[Scaling Under Load Simulator](./scaling-load-simulator/index.md)**

    Send animated traffic at servers and toggle between vertical and horizontal scaling strategies. Watch vertical scaling hit the hardware ceiling while horizontal scaling keeps adding instances.

-   **[Technical Debt Simulator](./technical-debt-simulator/index.md)**

    Play through 12 sprints choosing to ship fast or refactor. Watch how technical debt compounds into delivery slowdowns and compare your strategy against a balanced team.
