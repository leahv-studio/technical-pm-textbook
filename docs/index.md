Welcome to *From Product Manager to Technical Product Manager: A Practitioner's Guide*.

Not all technical product managers start as engineers. This textbook is designed for experienced product managers with 3-8 years of experience who want to transition into technical PM roles but didn't follow the traditional engineer-to-PM path. Whether your background is in art history, business, or any non-engineering field, this course proves that technical product management is accessible through deliberate learning, AI-augmented skill building, and practical application.

You'll learn to speak the language of engineers, understand system architecture, make data-driven decisions, and confidently navigate technical trade-offs — all while leveraging the product instincts you've already developed.

**The AI Advantage:** Generative AI tools are democratizing technical knowledge, making this transition more achievable than ever. This course teaches you how to leverage AI assistants for learning technical concepts, debugging code, analyzing data, and understanding system designs.

There are three key sections to get started:

1. [Course Description](./course-description.md) - A detailed overview of the course including topics covered and learning objectives aligned to Bloom's Taxonomy.
2. [Chapters](./chapters/index.md) - 14 chapters covering the full journey from PM foundations to career transition and technical leadership.
3. [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) - Setup instructions and prerequisites for working through the course materials.
