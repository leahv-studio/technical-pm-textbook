# Course Title
From Product Manager to Technical Product Manager: A Practitioner's Guide

## Target Audience
Product managers with 3-8 years of experience who want to transition into technical product management roles. Assumes familiarity with basic product management concepts but no prior programming or technical background required.

## Course Overview
Not all technical product managers start as engineers. This course is designed for experienced product managers who want to transition into technical PM roles but didn't follow the traditional engineer-to-PM path.

Drawing from real-world experience managing software products, this course bridges the gap between business-focused product management and the technical depth required for technical PM roles. You'll learn to speak the language of engineers, understand system architecture, make data-driven decisions, and confidently navigate technical trade-offs - all while leveraging the product instincts you've already developed.

**The AI Advantage:** Generative AI tools are democratizing technical knowledge, making this transition more achievable than ever. This course teaches you how to leverage AI assistants for learning technical concepts, debugging code, analyzing data, and understanding system designs - skills that would have traditionally required years of engineering experience. As AI reshapes the product management landscape, technical PMs who can effectively collaborate with both AI tools and engineering teams will be uniquely positioned to drive innovation.

Whether your background is in art history, business, or any non-engineering field, this course proves that technical product management is accessible through deliberate learning, AI-augmented skill building, and practical application. You'll build the technical foundation that complements your existing PM skills, preparing you to compete for technical PM roles in an AI-integrated industry.

## Prerequisites
- 3+ years product management experience
- Basic understanding of software development lifecycle
- Willingness to learn technical concepts

## Main Topics Covered
This course addresses the following key topics:

- Technical vocabulary and terminology for product managers
- System architecture fundamentals and design patterns
- APIs and integrations in product development
- Databases and SQL for product insights
- Software development lifecycle and Agile methodologies
- Technical debt and code quality considerations
- Data-driven decision making and analytics
- AI tools for technical PMs (Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot)
- Technical roadmapping and prioritization
- Build vs. buy analysis and technical tradeoffs
- Technical communication with engineering teams
- Career transition strategies for technical PM roles

## Topics Not Covered
This course explicitly excludes the following topics to maintain focus:

- Full-stack software engineering and production code development
- Advanced algorithms and data structures
- DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure management
- Machine learning model development and training
- UX/UI design principles and user research methodologies
- Financial modeling, budgeting, and P&L management

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

### Remember:
- Define key technical terms used in software development (APIs, databases, microservices, technical debt)
- Identify the components of common system architectures
- List the technical skills most valued in technical PM job descriptions

### Understand:
- Explain how different technical decisions impact product scalability and performance
- Describe the software development lifecycle from a technical perspective
- Interpret technical documentation and engineering specifications

### Apply:
- Use SQL to query databases for product insights
- Leverage AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot) to understand technical concepts
- Communicate technical requirements to engineering teams effectively
- Write basic Python scripts for data analysis

### Analyze:
- Evaluate trade-offs between technical solutions (build vs. buy, monolith vs. microservices)
- Assess technical feasibility of product features
- Compare technical PM role requirements across different companies and industries

### Evaluate:
- Critique system architecture proposals for product scalability
- Justify technical decisions to stakeholders using data
- Assess when to escalate technical decisions vs. when to decide independently

### Create:
- Design data-driven product experiments using analytics tools
- Develop technical roadmaps that balance user needs with engineering constraints
- Build a personal technical learning plan for continued growth

## Key Concepts and Definitions

**Technical Product Manager (Technical PM):** A product manager who possesses deep technical knowledge and can engage directly with engineering teams on architecture, system design, and implementation decisions while maintaining focus on user needs and business outcomes.

**API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of protocols and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other, enabling product integrations and data exchange.

**System Architecture:** The fundamental structures of a software system, including its components, relationships, and design principles that guide implementation decisions.

**Technical Debt:** The implied cost of future reworking required when choosing an easy or quick solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer, impacting long-term product velocity.

**Data-Driven Decision Making:** The practice of basing product decisions on data analysis and interpretation rather than intuition alone, using metrics, analytics, and user behavior patterns.

**Agile Development:** An iterative software development methodology emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and continuous delivery of working software in short cycles (sprints).

**Generative AI:** Artificial intelligence systems that can create new content (text, code, images) based on patterns learned from training data, used as tools for learning, coding assistance, and problem-solving.

## Course Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be positioned to:

- **Compete confidently for technical PM roles** alongside candidates with traditional engineering backgrounds
- **Communicate effectively with engineering teams** using appropriate technical terminology and concepts
- **Make informed technical decisions** that balance user needs, business goals, and engineering constraints
- **Leverage AI tools strategically** to accelerate technical learning and enhance productivity
- **Deliver high-impact outcomes for technical products and teams** by bridging business strategy with technical execution
- **Continue learning independently** using AI assistants and technical resources to deepen expertise over time
