# Glossary of Product Management Terms

This glossary defines key product management concepts following ISO 11179 metadata registry standards: precise, concise, distinct, non-circular, and free of business rules.

#### Backlog

An ordered list of features, fixes, and improvements that a product team plans to deliver, ranked by priority and business value.

A well-maintained backlog serves as the single source of truth for what the team will work on next. It bridges the gap between strategic goals and day-to-day execution by making priorities visible to all stakeholders.

**Example:** A product manager moves a customer-requested search filter to the top of the backlog after usage data shows 40% of users attempt to filter results.

#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The simplest version of a product that delivers enough value to early users and generates validated learning about customer needs.

An MVP is not a half-built product but rather the smallest experiment that tests a core hypothesis. It reduces the risk of building something nobody wants by getting real feedback before committing to full development.

**Example:** A team launches an MVP of a scheduling tool with only calendar integration and basic booking, omitting advanced features like recurring events and team views.

#### Product-Market Fit

The degree to which a product satisfies strong market demand, evidenced by consistent user adoption, retention, and organic growth.

Product-market fit is the inflection point where a product shifts from struggling for traction to being pulled by customer demand. It is often described as the moment when users would be very disappointed if the product disappeared.

**Example:** A note-taking app achieves product-market fit when its monthly retention rate exceeds 60% and new users arrive primarily through word-of-mouth referrals.

#### Product Roadmap

A strategic document communicating the planned direction, priorities, and expected evolution of a product over time.

Roadmaps align teams and stakeholders around shared goals without over-committing to specific dates. They communicate the "why" behind planned work and help teams make trade-off decisions when new opportunities or constraints arise.

**Example:** A quarterly roadmap shows three themes — onboarding improvements, API expansion, and mobile support — each tied to specific business outcomes rather than feature lists.

#### Product Requirements Document (PRD)

A written specification describing the purpose, features, behavior, and success criteria for a product or feature to be built.

A PRD translates business objectives and user needs into actionable guidance for engineering and design teams. It defines what to build and why, while leaving implementation details to the builders.

**Example:** A PRD for a notification system specifies user personas, delivery channels, opt-out behavior, and the target metric of reducing missed appointments by 25%.

#### Sprint

A fixed-duration iteration, typically one to four weeks, during which a cross-functional team completes a defined set of work items.

Sprints create a predictable rhythm for planning, building, and reviewing work. The time constraint forces teams to break large efforts into deliverable increments and regularly reassess priorities.

**Example:** During a two-week sprint, a team commits to completing three user stories: account deletion flow, password reset redesign, and email verification improvements.

#### Stakeholder

Any person or group with a vested interest in a product's decisions, progress, or outcomes, including users, executives, and partner teams.

Effective stakeholder management involves understanding each group's priorities and concerns, then communicating relevant information at the right level of detail. Misaligned stakeholders are a common source of project delays and scope changes.

**Example:** For a payments feature, stakeholders include the finance team (compliance requirements), customer support (handling disputes), and end users (checkout experience).

#### User Persona

A research-based, fictional representation of a key user segment that describes their goals, behaviors, pain points, and context of use.

Personas prevent teams from designing for an abstract "average user" by grounding decisions in specific, realistic profiles. They are most effective when derived from actual user research rather than assumptions.

**Example:** "Alex, a freelance designer" is a persona who needs fast invoicing, struggles with expense tracking, and primarily works from a mobile device between client meetings.

#### User Story

A short, structured description of a desired capability written from the perspective of the user, following the format: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."

User stories keep the focus on user value rather than technical implementation. They serve as conversation starters between product, design, and engineering rather than exhaustive specifications.

**Example:** "As a team lead, I want to export weekly reports as PDFs so that I can share progress with clients who don't have platform access."

#### Value Proposition

A clear statement describing the specific benefit a product delivers to its target customers and how it differs from alternatives.

A strong value proposition answers three questions: who is this for, what problem does it solve, and why is this solution better than the alternatives. It guides messaging, feature prioritization, and go-to-market strategy.

**Example:** "We help small retailers manage inventory across online and physical stores in one dashboard, eliminating the manual spreadsheet reconciliation that takes hours each week."
