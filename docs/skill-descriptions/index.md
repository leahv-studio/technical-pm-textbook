## Educational Framework

All skills follow these educational principles:

- **Bloom's Taxonomy (2001)**: Six cognitive levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
- **ISO 11179 Standards**: Metadata registry standards for glossary definitions
- **Learning Graphs**: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) showing concept prerequisites
- **Five Intelligence Levels**: From static text (L1) to AI-powered personalization (L5)
- **MicroSim Pattern**: Standardized interactive simulations for educational content
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant design with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Technology Stack

These skills leverage modern web technologies:

- **MkDocs with Material Theme**: Static site generation and documentation
- **p5.js**: Interactive educational simulations
- **vis-network.js, vis-timeline.js**: Network and timeline visualizations
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization and charts
- **Mermaid.js**: Workflow and process diagrams
- **venn.js & D3.js**: Set theory visualizations
- **Python**: Data processing and validation scripts
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting and deployment

## Getting Started

To use these skills with Claude Code:

1. Install skills globally or per-project using `/scripts/install-claude-skills.sh`
2. View available skills with `/skills` command
3. Invoke skills by name when working on educational content
4. Skills coordinate automatically - e.g., glossary-generator creates definitions that venn-diagram-generator uses
