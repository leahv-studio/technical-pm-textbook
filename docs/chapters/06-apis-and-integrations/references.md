# References: APIs and Integrations

1. **[API (Application Programming Interface) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)**
    Broad overview of APIs, their history, types, and role in enabling software systems to communicate. Establishes the foundational vocabulary PMs need to discuss integration strategies with engineering teams.

2. **[REST (Representational State Transfer) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)**
    Explains REST architectural principles including statelessness, resource-based URLs, and standard HTTP methods. Critical for PMs working with web APIs, which overwhelmingly follow RESTful conventions.

3. **[GraphQL - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL)**
    Covers the GraphQL query language, its development at Facebook, and how it differs from REST approaches. Helps PMs evaluate when GraphQL is advantageous for their product's data-fetching requirements.

4. **Lauret, Arnaud. *The Design of Web APIs*. Manning Publications, 2019.**
    Practical guide to designing user-friendly APIs with a focus on developer experience, versioning, and documentation. Teaches PMs how to evaluate API design quality and advocate for developer-centric decisions.

5. **Biehl, Matthias. *API Strategy for Decision Makers*. API-University Press, 2018.**
    Covers API strategy from a business perspective, including monetization models, partner ecosystems, and platform thinking. Directly relevant for PMs who own API products or manage third-party integration strategies.

6. **[HTTP Methods Explained - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)**
    Mozilla's authoritative reference for HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with clear examples and usage guidelines. Essential for PMs who read API documentation and participate in endpoint design discussions.

7. **[API Authentication Best Practices - Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization)**
    Explains authentication and authorization mechanisms including OAuth 2.0, API keys, and token-based access control. Helps PMs define security requirements and understand how API access is protected.

8. **[Rate Limiting Strategies - Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/rate-limiters)**
    Stripe's engineering blog on rate limiting approaches, including token bucket and sliding window algorithms. Gives PMs practical insight into how APIs protect themselves from abuse while maintaining service quality.

9. **[What Is an API Gateway? - Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-does-an-api-gateway-do)**
    Explains API gateway functionality including request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring in one layer. Relevant for PMs managing products with multiple backend services exposed through unified API endpoints.

10. **[Webhooks Explained - SendGrid](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook)**
    Practical introduction to webhooks as event-driven integrations, explaining how they differ from polling-based approaches. Useful for PMs designing real-time notification systems and third-party integration workflows.
