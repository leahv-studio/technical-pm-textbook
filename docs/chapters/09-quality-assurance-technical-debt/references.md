# References: Quality Assurance and Technical Debt

1. **[Technical Debt - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)**
    Defines technical debt as a software engineering metaphor, covering causes, types, and management strategies that PMs must understand to balance feature velocity against codebase health.

2. **[Code Refactoring - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)**
    Explains refactoring techniques and motivations for restructuring existing code without changing external behavior, providing PMs context for why engineering teams request dedicated refactoring sprints.

3. **[Software Testing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing)**
    Broad overview of testing methodologies including unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing levels, giving PMs foundational knowledge of the testing pyramid and quality assurance practices.

4. **"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler (Addison-Wesley, 2nd Edition, 2018)**
    The definitive guide to code refactoring patterns and practices, helping PMs understand the systematic approach engineers use to reduce technical debt and improve code quality.

5. **"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin (Prentice Hall, 2008)**
    Foundational text on writing maintainable, readable code with principles that PMs should understand when evaluating code quality standards and establishing engineering team expectations.

6. **[Martin Fowler: Technical Debt](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html)**
    Fowler's influential essay categorizing technical debt into deliberate vs. inadvertent and reckless vs. prudent quadrants, a framework PMs can use when prioritizing debt reduction work.

7. **[Google Testing Blog](https://testing.googleblog.com/)**
    Google's engineering blog on testing practices covering test automation, flaky tests, and testing culture, offering enterprise-scale insights that PMs can apply to their own QA strategies.

8. **[Test Pyramid - Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)**
    Practical guide to structuring automated tests across unit, integration, and end-to-end layers, helping PMs understand testing investment trade-offs and coverage strategies.

9. **[OWASP Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)**
    Industry-standard security testing methodology covering vulnerability categories and testing procedures that PMs need when defining security requirements and coordinating penetration testing efforts.

10. **[Atlassian: Understanding Code Coverage](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/code-coverage)**
    Practical explanation of code coverage metrics, their benefits and limitations, helping PMs set realistic quality targets without over-relying on coverage as a sole quality indicator.
