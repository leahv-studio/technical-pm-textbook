# About This Textbook

## From Product Manager to Technical Product Manager: A Practitioner's Guide

Not all technical product managers start as engineers. This textbook was written for product managers like me who want to transition into technical PM roles without following the traditional engineer-to-PM path.

After several years in product management, I found myself increasingly drawn to the technical side of the products I was managing. I could articulate user needs, prioritize backlogs, and drive strategy, but I wanted to go deeper. I wanted to understand the systems I was building, speak the language of the engineers I worked with, and make informed technical decisions rather than deferring every architecture question to someone else.

This textbook is the resource I wish I had when I started that journey.

## A Graduate Project in Digital Transformation

This textbook was created as part of my graduate program in Information Technology, with a focus on Digital Transformation with Generative AI. The program challenged me to think about how AI tools are reshaping industries and professional roles, and product management is no exception.

Generative AI is democratizing technical knowledge in ways that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. Tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot make it possible for non-engineers to understand codebases, debug issues, analyze data, and learn technical concepts on demand. This textbook embraces that reality. Rather than asking readers to spend years in computer science programs, it shows how AI-augmented learning can accelerate the path to technical fluency.

The textbook itself was built using these same AI tools, specifically Anthropic's Claude with a suite of Claude Code skills designed for generating intelligent textbooks. The entire process, from course description through learning graph generation, chapter creation, glossary, quizzes, and interactive simulations, demonstrates what becomes possible when you pair domain expertise with AI-assisted content creation.

## What This Textbook Covers

The book is organized into 14 chapters spanning the technical knowledge that matters most for product managers:

- **Product management foundations** and how they connect to technical depth
- **Software development essentials** including version control, code review, and development workflows
- **System architecture** from monoliths to microservices to cloud infrastructure
- **APIs and integrations** that power modern software products
- **Databases and SQL** for direct access to product data and insights
- **Agile methodologies** and the software development lifecycle from a technical perspective
- **Quality assurance and technical debt** management
- **Analytics and data-driven decision making** including experimentation and statistical thinking
- **AI tools and strategy** for technical PMs in an AI-integrated industry
- **Career transition guidance** for making the move into technical PM roles

Each chapter builds on a learning graph of 200 concepts with carefully mapped dependencies, ensuring you develop technical knowledge in the right order.

## Who This Is For

This textbook is for product managers with 3-8 years of experience who want to transition into technical product management roles. It assumes familiarity with core product management concepts but no prior programming or engineering background.

Whether your undergraduate degree is in business, the humanities, or any non-engineering field, this book is designed to prove that technical product management is accessible through deliberate learning, practical application, and strategic use of AI tools.

## How This Textbook Was Built

This is a Level 2+ intelligent textbook built with MkDocs and the Material theme. It features:

- A **learning graph** of 200 concepts with dependency mapping to guide the learning sequence
- **Interactive MicroSims** built with p5.js, Chart.js, and other JavaScript libraries
- **Chapter quizzes** aligned to Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels
- A **comprehensive glossary** with ISO 11179-compliant definitions
- **Data-driven metrics** tracking content quality and coverage

The content was generated using Claude Code skills, a collection of autonomous AI agents that automate specific aspects of educational content creation. Each skill follows structured workflows to produce consistent, standards-compliant output, from generating the initial learning graph through final quality validation.

## Acknowledgments

This project would not have been possible without the guidance of my graduate program faculty, the open-source tools that power modern educational content (MkDocs, Material theme, p5.js), and the AI capabilities that made it feasible for a single author to produce a comprehensive, interactive textbook.

Most importantly, this textbook reflects the real experiences of navigating the transition from product manager to technical product manager. The technical concepts are presented not from an engineer's perspective, but from the perspective of someone who has been in the room making product decisions and needed to understand the technology behind them.
