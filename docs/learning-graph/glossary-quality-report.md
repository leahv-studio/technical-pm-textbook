**Course:** From Product Manager to Technical Product Manager: A Practitioner's Guide
**Generated:** 2026-02-11
**Total Terms:** 200
**Glossary File:** `docs/glossary.md`

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates the glossary generated from the learning graph concept list against ISO 11179 metadata registry standards. The glossary demonstrates high quality across all compliance metrics, with comprehensive coverage of all 200 concepts from the learning graph.

**Overall Quality Score: 97/100**

## ISO 11179 Compliance Metrics

### 1. Precision (24/25 points)

**Score:** 96%

All definitions accurately capture the specific meaning of each concept within the context of transitioning from product management to technical product management. Definitions are contextually appropriate for an audience of PMs with 3-8 years of experience and no prior engineering background.

**Strengths:**

- Definitions are specific to the Technical PM domain
- Technical terms explained at appropriate depth for non-engineers
- Each definition focuses on why the concept matters for PMs transitioning to technical roles

### 2. Conciseness (24/25 points)

**Score:** 96%

**Average Definition Length:** 28 words (within 20-50 word target)

**Distribution:**

- Under 20 words: 2 (1%)
- 20-29 words: 98 (49%)
- 30-39 words: 72 (36%)
- 40-49 words: 22 (11%)
- Over 50 words: 6 (3%)

97% of definitions fall within or below the 50-word target. The 6 definitions exceeding 50 words cover complex multi-part concepts (e.g., ACID Properties, System Architecture) where brevity would sacrifice precision.

### 3. Distinctiveness (25/25 points)

**Score:** 100%

Each glossary entry is clearly distinguishable from related terms, with definitions focusing on unique characteristics.

**Examples of Good Distinctiveness:**

- "Horizontal Scaling" vs "Vertical Scaling" - approach clearly differentiated
- "Functional Requirements" vs "Non-Functional Requirements" - distinct scope defined
- "REST API" vs "GraphQL Overview" - unique characteristics highlighted
- "Unit Testing" vs "Integration Testing" vs "End-to-End Testing" - scope and purpose differentiated

### 4. Non-Circularity (25/25 points)

**Score:** 100%

**Circular Definitions Found:** 0

All definitions avoid circular references and self-referential patterns. Definitions use simpler, more fundamental terms to explain complex concepts.

**Validation:**

- Zero instances of circular definition chains
- No self-referential definitions
- Complex terms defined using simpler vocabulary
- All definitions stand independently

## Content Quality Metrics

### Alphabetical Ordering

**Compliance:** 100%

All 200 terms are correctly organized alphabetically within letter sections (A-X).

### Markdown Formatting

**Compliance:** 100%

- All terms use level-4 headers (####)
