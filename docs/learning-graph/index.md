# Learning Graph

This section contains the learning graph for *From Product Manager to Technical Product Manager: A Practitioner's Guide*. The learning graph maps all 200 concepts in this textbook and their prerequisite relationships, creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that shows how ideas build on each other.

## What Is a Learning Graph?

A learning graph is a network of concepts connected by directed edges that indicate prerequisites. Each concept is a node, and each edge means "you should understand this concept before moving to the next one."

- **Foundational concepts** on the left have no prerequisites — they are starting points like "Product Management"
- **Advanced concepts** on the right depend on understanding multiple earlier concepts
- The longest learning path spans 11 concepts, from Product Management through to Statistical Significance

The graph ensures that no chapter introduces a concept before its prerequisites have been covered.
