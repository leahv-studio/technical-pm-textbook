**Weakest Coverage:** APIs and Integrations (65%), Databases and Data (72%)

## Recommendations

1. **Address all 8 critical gaps** by adding questions in a future FAQ update
2. **Improve APIs and Integrations coverage** by adding 3-5 questions about API Gateway, SDKs, serialization, and error handling
3. **Improve Databases coverage** by adding 3-4 questions about normalization, indexing, and data migration
4. **Medium and low priority gaps** can be addressed incrementally in future updates
5. Current 82% coverage is strong for an initial FAQ generation; target 90%+ in the next iteration
