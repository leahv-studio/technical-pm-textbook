# Getting Started

Welcome to *From Product Manager to Technical Product Manager: A Practitioner's Guide*.

This textbook is designed for product managers with 3-8 years of experience who want to transition into technical PM roles. No prior engineering or programming background is required.

## How to Use This Textbook

### Read the Chapters in Order

The 14 chapters are organized as a learning progression, with each chapter building on concepts introduced in earlier ones. Start with [Chapter 1: Product Management Foundations](chapters/01-pm-foundations/index.md) and work through sequentially for the best experience.

If you already have experience with certain topics, you can skip ahead. Check the [learning graph](learning-graph/index.md) to see concept dependencies and identify which prerequisites you need for any given chapter.

### Use the Reference Materials

- **[Glossary](glossary.md)** - Definitions of all 200 key concepts, written from a PM perspective
- **[FAQ](faq.md)** - Answers to 80 common questions organized by category
- **[Course Description](course-description.md)** - Full overview of topics, learning objectives, and outcomes

### Explore the Interactive Elements

Each chapter includes interactive MicroSims that let you explore technical concepts visually. You can adjust parameters, observe outcomes, and build intuition through hands-on experimentation. Browse all available simulations in the [MicroSims](sims/index.md) section.

### Test Your Understanding

Chapter quizzes are aligned to Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels, testing your knowledge from basic recall through analysis and evaluation. Use them to identify areas where you may need additional review.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- **3+ years of product management experience** - You understand roadmaps, backlogs, stakeholder management, and the basics of shipping products
- **Basic familiarity with the software development lifecycle** - You know what sprints, releases, and deployments are, even if you don't understand the technical details
- **Willingness to learn technical concepts** - This textbook will push you outside your comfort zone, and that's the point

### Optional but Helpful

- **Access to an AI assistant** (Claude, ChatGPT, or similar) - The textbook teaches you how to use AI tools for technical learning, and having one available to practice with will accelerate your progress
- **A SQL playground** - Free options like [SQLite Online](https://sqliteonline.com/) or [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/) let you practice the SQL concepts covered in Chapters 7 and 8

## Suggested Study Approach

### For a Structured Learning Path (3-4 Months)

Dedicate 2-4 hours per week and work through one chapter every 1-2 weeks:

1. **Weeks 1-4**: Chapters 1-3 (PM foundations, software development, documentation)
2. **Weeks 5-8**: Chapters 4-6 (architecture, cloud, APIs)
3. **Weeks 9-12**: Chapters 7-10 (databases, data management, quality, Agile)
4. **Weeks 13-16**: Chapters 11-14 (analytics, experimentation, AI tools, career transition)

### For Quick Reference

If you're preparing for a specific interview or need to understand a particular topic:

1. Look up the concept in the [glossary](glossary.md)
2. Find the relevant chapter using the [table of contents](chapters/index.md)
3. Review the chapter content and try the interactive MicroSims
4. Test your understanding with the chapter quiz

### For AI-Augmented Learning

As you work through each chapter, practice using AI tools to deepen your understanding:

- Ask Claude or ChatGPT to explain concepts in different ways
- Use AI to generate practice scenarios related to your actual product
- Have AI tools help you write SQL queries or read code snippets
- Chapter 13 covers [AI tools and strategy](chapters/13-ai-tools-and-strategy/index.md) in depth

## What You Will Be Able to Do

By the end of this textbook, you will be able to:

- **Speak the language of engineers** using appropriate technical terminology
- **Evaluate system architecture proposals** and ask informed questions
- **Write SQL queries** to answer product questions directly from data
- **Understand APIs** well enough to scope integrations and review documentation
- **Navigate Agile ceremonies** with technical depth, not just process knowledge
- **Use AI tools strategically** to accelerate your technical learning
- **Make informed build-versus-buy decisions** with both business and technical context
- **Prepare for technical PM interviews** with confidence
